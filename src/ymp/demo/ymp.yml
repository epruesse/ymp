    # The `data` field specifies a TSV, CSV or Excel sheet containing
    # the experiment matrix. It should have at least one column each
    # for forward and reverse reads (if available) and an identifying
    # (=unique) column. Additional data columns can be used for
    # grouping data (e.g. for co-assemblies within subjects sampled
    # multiple timees, or to merge technical replicates).
    # The field may be a list of files, which will be concatenated.

    # contain the name of a barcode file for demultiplexing reads.

limits:
  # Set resource limits. These act as minimum/maximum for build in
  # memory requirements. Set this to the minimum and maximum memory
  # any job may try to request. E.g. the maximum memory on any of your
  # compute nodes, or the maximum you want to use on your local
  # machine.

pipelines:
  # Pipelines are sequential combinations of stages. Once your workflow
  # becomes longer, this will be required to keep filename lengths
  # below 254 characters. It also helps with the amount of typing.
  # Warning: Change pipelines with care. Changes do not (always)
  #          automatically lead to recomputation!
  trim:
    # Use as shortcut for a single stage:
    - trim_bbmap
  map:
    # Use as shortcut for a few stages:
    - index_bowtie2
    - map_bowtie2
  assembly:
    # Use pipelines in pipelines:
